I love Visual Studio for C# coding, but JavaScript not so much.

- EditorConfig for VS Code - automatically sets editor coding styles like tabs and indentation levels
- C# - nice to have if you want to quick-tweak a Razor template or POCO without having to switch back to Visual Studio

- vscode-icons - adds different icons based on file type to the Editor view

## [Sublime Text 3](https://www.sublimetext.com/3)

First install the [Package Control](https://packagecontrol.io/) addon. This is my preferred "other than Visual Studio" editor, but you have to
purchase a license. It says "in beta" on the site, but I have been reliably using this for years now.

- AdvancedNewFile - to start a new file just hit ```ctl+alt+n``` then start typing the path of the file you want to create relative to the root of the project. **ninja magic**
- AutoFileName - will offer autocompletion of filenames it finds in the project - recognizes relative paths
- Babel - adds recognition and highlighting for ES6 and React
- ChangeQuotes - change surrounding quotes to single (') or double ("") automatically - smart enough to escape any conflicting quotes in the middle of the string
- Color Highlighter - recognizes hex and rgb color codes and underlines in that color
- EditorConfig - automatically sets editor coding styles like tabs and indentation levels
- Emmet - [Emmet](http://emmet.io/) is amazing for quickly writing lots of boilerplate HTML, if you don't know it you should [read up on it](https://www.smashingmagazine.com/2013/03/goodbye-zen-coding-hello-emmet/)
- HTML-CSS-JS Prettify - auto-format code pasted in from elsewhere
- JavaScriptNext - ES6 Syntax - ES6 language definition for Sublime

- Razor - for editing Razor templates in Sublime
- Sass - SASS support
- SCSS - SCSS specific syntax support

- SublimeLinter - the Sublime linting engine
- SublimeLinter-contrib-standard - [JavaScript Standard Style](http://standardjs.com/) definitions for SublimeLinter

## [WebStorm](https://www.jetbrains.com/webstorm/)

Pretty much comes pre-loaded with everything you need for front-end web development including grunt/gulp/editorconfig/webpack integrations.
This software is from [JetBrains](https://www.jetbrains.com/) so it requires a separate license.
